## Architectural Principles

This project serves as an exercise in clean Python development, focusing on the following architectural principles:
* **Immutability:** The core game state is maintained without mutation; every move returns a brand new copy of the board.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Logic (checking winner, validating moves) is kept separate from I/O (getting input, rendering the board).
* **Robust Testing:** Every major component is unit-tested using Python's `unittest` module, including techniques like mocking user input to ensure reliability.



## How to Run the Game

This game runs directly in your command-line environment and requires no external dependencies beyond the standard Python library.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.6+**

### Execution

1.  Navigate to the **root directory** of the project (the folder containing the `src/` and `tests/` directories).
2.  Execute the game using the following command:

    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

    The game will start immediately, display the position guide, and prompt the first player ('X') for a move.



## Testing Instructions

This project is built using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, with every function verified by unit tests.

### How to Run Tests

1.  Ensure you are in the project's **root directory** (the folder containing `src/` and `tests/`).
2.  Execute the test suite using Python's built-in `unittest` module with the `discover` and `buffer` flags:

    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover -b
    ```

    * **`discover`** automatically finds all files named `test*.py`.
    * **`-b` (buffer)** silences all the `print` output (like error messages from mocked input) from successful tests, keeping the test run clean.

### Expected Output

A successful test run will be silent, showing only the final summary indicating the number of tests run and that everything passed.



## Project Structure

The repository follows a standard modern Python layout:

```text

‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_engine.py      # Unit tests for all functions in src/engine.py

## Future Development & Learning Roadmap

This project currently serves as a core demonstration of clean Python architecture and robust unit testing. The game engine logic has been strictly isolated to provide a solid, immutable foundation for extensive expansion.

The ideas below represent potential paths for exploration and learning. They are not commitments, but rather opportunities to tackle new domains of software development and showcase expanding skills.

### Key Expansion and Learning Goals

| Feature Idea | Technical Goal (What to Learn) | Architectural Impact |
| :------------------------------- | :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Tier AI Opponent**       | Master algorithmic thinking by building AI difficulties: from Random Selection to Heuristic Algorithms (e.g., Minimax). | Requires a new `src/ai/` module. AI functions must be pure, consuming the immutable game state and returning a coordinate. |
| **Advanced User Interface (UX)** | Explore human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts. Goals range from basic CLI enhancements (color, ASCII art flair) to full-scale Graphical User Interface (GUI) development (e.g., using Tkinter, PyQt, or a browser-based front-end). | Introduces a new layer of presentation logic. The existing `prettify_board()` function will be replaced or supplemented by new renderers that consume the state from `engine.py`. |
| **Persistent Player Statistics** | Explore data persistence by integrating a database layer. This involves learning about data modeling, relational schemas, and general CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. | Requires a new Persistence Layer that separates database logic from the game engine. New files would handle database connection, queries, and data mapping. |
| **Local Network Multiplayer**    | Deep dive into networking protocols, specifically TCP/IP for connection handling and reliable data transfer. The goal is to separate the CLI interface into distinct Client and Server applications. | Requires a new `src/networking/` package. The game loop in `main.py` would need to be re-engineered to handle latency and state synchronization across two machines. |
| **Real-Time Communication**      | Explore asynchronous programming concepts (e.g., `asyncio`). The objective is to manage a persistent, low-latency communication channel (for features like in-game chat) without blocking the core game's execution flow. | Introduces new challenges in concurrency and handling simultaneous data streams, requiring deep knowledge of non-blocking I/O. |


### Architectural Focus Moving Forward

Every feature added will reinforce the project's original principles:
* **Immutability**: The core engine.py will remain pure; new features will consume the state but not mutate it.
* **Testing**: New modules (AI, DB, Network) will be covered by their own comprehensive unit and integration tests.
* **Separation of Concerns**: Maintaining strict boundaries between Game Engine (logic), Persistence (database), and I/O (CLI/Network).
